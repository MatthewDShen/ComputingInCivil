A new instance of the ``Roster`` class must be initialized with the course name and term only, such as:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> ceuy3013 = Roster('Computing in Civil Engineering', 'Spring 2021')\n","```\n","\n","No students should be added at initialization, instead, a new student can be added with an ``add_student`` method which takes the name, email, level and current GPA of the student, such as:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> ceuy3013.add_student('Monica Geller', 'mg999@nyu.edu', 'Junior', 3.86)\n","'Monica Geller was added to the roster'\n","```\n","\n","Notice that the ``add_student`` returns a success message 'Monica Geller was added to the roster'. In fact, we have a 2.0 threshold for adding students to the roster. Which means that adding a student with a GPA below 2.0 will return a different message:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> ceuy3013.add_student('Chandler Bing', 'cb999@nyu.edu', 'Junior', 1.65)\n","'Chandler Bing could not be added because their current GPA is below 2.0'\n","```\n","\n","At which point we can use ``print`` and see all students in our roster.\n","\n","```python\n",">>> print(ceuy3013)\n","\"[['Monica Geller', 'mg999@nyu.edu', 'Junior', 3.86]]\"\n","```\n","\n","And if we add a few more with GPA above 2.0, the print statement will return the following:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> print(ceuy3013)\n","\"[['Monica Geller', 'mg999@nyu.edu', 'Junior', 3.86], ['Jack Smith', 'js999@nyu.edu', 'Sophomore', 2.8], ['Jane Clack', 'jc999@nyu.edu', 'Senior', 3.34], ['Mary Stevens', 'ms999@nyu.edu', 'Sophomore', 2.95]]\"\n","```\n","\n","We should get total enrollment with ``len``:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> len(ceuy3013)\n","4\n","```\n","\n","Next, the ``Roster`` class should also have a method that removes a student by their email, ``remove_student`` (bonus points if your ``add_student`` method also makes sure that all emails in the roster are unique). The method should work like this:\n","\n","```python \n",">>> ceuy3013.remove_student('mg999@nyu.edu')\n","'Monica Geller was removed from the roster'\n","```\n","\n","And we can verify by printing the roster again:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> print(ceuy3013)\n","\"[['Jack Smith', 'js999@nyu.edu', 'Sophomore', 2.8], ['Jane Clack', 'jc999@nyu.edu', 'Senior', 3.34], ['Mary Stevens', 'ms999@nyu.edu', 'Sophomore', 2.95]]\"\n","```\n","\n","Finally, there needs to be a method, ``avg_gpa``, that returns the average GPA of the enrolled students. Assuming we have the three students shown above, the result should be:\n","\n","```python\n",">>> ceuy3013.avg_gpa()\n","3.03\n","```\n","\n","Once again, **show all work!!!**. You do not need any external libraries to complete this assignment. Fill in your code below.
